Monsters Burn
=============
Monsters Burn is a game where you play as a monster and you have to burn down the city. The game is a 2D platformer with a top-down view. The game is made in Unity and is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. (not available yet, nor ever. It was an AI suggestion and made me laugh)

- Very basic setup to enable all monsters to burn in the sun.
- Configurable:
    - dimensions to apply to monster burning to (whitelist/blacklist support)
    - force monsters on the surface to always burn during the day (regardless of sun brightness, e.g. rain)
    - enable/disable monster loot drop

in all your ways acknowledge Him,
and He will make your paths straight.
